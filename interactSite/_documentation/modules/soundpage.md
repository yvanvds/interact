# Sound Page
This module can be used to add sound files to your project. Right now, it supports `.wav` and `.ogg` files. Due to very complicated reasons it will not work on clients right now, but this will be implemented soon.

Sounds can be added with the green `Add Sound` button. This will copy the selected file to the project directory. Limited functionality is available from this page itself, which is intended for testing purposes. Sounds can be the target of other elements though, allowing the manipulation of a lot more values, like volume, speed and position.

When you need two instances of the same sound, you should use the copy button of the first sound. This will allow Interact to open just a single audio file with multiple pointers to it, thus saving memory.
