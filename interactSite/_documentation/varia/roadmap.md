Note: The items on this roadmap are not in any particular order. I just add everything I plan to do to this list, but some ideas take longer to implement than others.

- Release a client for Windows IOT. (Can be used for raspberry pi and other kits)
- Redesign the sound page: Sounds should be circles that can be dragged around (with multitouch support) to move them in a 3D space. Sound properties should be shown on the side when a circle is selected. Scrolling over a sound (or pinching) should adjust its volume.
- Better code feedback and intellisense.
- Check the multitouchPad for problems.
- Write demo projects.
- Write more documentation.
- Improve textbox gui element.
- Chain sounds with audio patchers.  
- Add composition related libraries to script interface.
- Gui Interface for Resolume, Max/MSP and Pure Data.
- Research the possibility to implement an internal video renderer, with layered video.
