## Server

The Interact Server is available for Windows platforms (tested on Windows 10). Because the server needs to open and maintain network connections to all clients, you need administrative privileges on your machine to run the Server.

### Current Version

[Interact Server 0.6](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mute-interact.appspot.com/o/Server%2FInteract%20Server-0.6.msi?alt=media&token=884c403b-8ec1-4153-88c9-bad473a4cd7f) (Released on november 27, 2018)

## Client

### Android
The current version of the client can be downloaded from [google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mute.interact).

### Universal Windows Application

This package can be installed on a Windows 10 computer (Unpack and double click the `.appxbundle` file). It also contains the ARM version which can be installed on a Raspberry PI (instructions can be found [here](/documentation/varia/pi/).).
