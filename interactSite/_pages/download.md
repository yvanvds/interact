## Server

The Interact Server is available for Windows platforms (tested on Windows 10). Because the server needs to open and maintain network connections to all clients, you need administrative privileges on your machine to run the Server.

### Current Version

[Interact Server 0.3](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mute-interact.appspot.com/o/Server%2FInteract%20Server-0.3.msi?alt=media&token=d8ba3812-ef6f-4def-bf95-21a3141076f1) (Released on october 21, 2018)

This version uses an evaluation version of the Actipro SyntaxEditor. While being a valuable addition for the code module, I still have to secure funding for its license. This is why you will get a popup when opening a project, asking you to purchase a license. You don't have to do that. The license has to be bought by the software developer (me). I assume I will get one in a few weeks.

### Older versions

[Interact Server 0.2](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mute-interact.appspot.com/o/Server%2FInteract%20Server-0.2.msi?alt=media&token=ebb8eb8f-7de8-4a7b-b0cd-d9687cc15231) (Released on may 10, 2018)
