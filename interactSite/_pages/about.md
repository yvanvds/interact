Interact is a developer platform for interactive art. It is developed by yvan vander sanden [MuteCode.com](https://mutecode.com) with funding by [Musica, Impulse Center for Music](https://www.musica.be) and C-Takt. Interact is open source software. All code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/yvanvds/interact). 

Interact is actually a combination of different project, tied together. There is a windows development application and server, and clients exist for Android and Raspberry PI (using Windows Iot). Projects used inside Interact are:
- [YSE](https://github.com/yvanvds/yse-soundengine): an inovative (3D) sound engine with DSP functionality, currently running on the server and the android client;
- [YAP](https://yap.mutecode.com/): a visual patcher system;
- [OSCGui](https://github.com/yvanvds/OSCGui): a C# Gui library with a focus on audio interfaces;
- [OSCTree](https://github.com/yvanvds/OscTree): a C# routing library to facilitate internal message routing in an OSC like manner.

All the libraries above are developed by yvan vander sanden.

The Interact Server also uses the [Actipro SyntaxEditor](https://www.actiprosoftware.com/products/controls/wpf/syntaxeditor). If you ever need a code editor inside an application, this library is a great choice!
